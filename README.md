# [freeCodeCamp - Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-scatterplot-graph)

# About

It is a project for the freeCodeCamp Data Visualization certification - [Data Visualization](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/).

This project requires us to create a scatterplot graph by using the dataset provided by freeCodeCamp with D3 which is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/GrZVaM)

# Technologies

- Using **D3.js library** to build a scatterplot graph
